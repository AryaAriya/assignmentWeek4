             <h2>I enjoy watching - and analyzing - movies</h2>
               <p> As a movie buff, movies are more than just entertainment—they are stories that inspire, challenge, and connect us. 
                My site is fully dedicated to sharing thoughtful reviews and opinions of films I’ve watched and enjoyed. Here, you’ll find reviews - and musings - across a wide range of genres ranging from sci-fi to horror to drama to spy to fantasy. 
                Whether you’re looking for recommendations or just want to read opinions, this site is a space to celebrate cinema together.</p>

        <!--Sub Heading 2-->
           <h2>Watching with friends and family</h2>
              <p>I often watch movies with my family, especially my mom. We both go out and watch movies together. 
            At the end of it, I discuss the movie with her, and then after that I go and do my own analysis and opinions, and other stuff of that movie.
            Don't worry, though, as her views and opinions won't come here on this page, as this site is strictly only my reviews and musings, and thoughts on movies.</p>

        <!--Sub Heading 3-->
          <h2>Bad Movie Hobbies - Finding out the ratings of the worst movies ever so I can laugh at them</h2>
            <p> One of my movie hobbies is to watch, read, and watch reviews of bad movies just so I can laugh at them. 
                It's so funny just reading how bad the movies are and then seeing people discuss them on video.
                I'll definitely do something like that on this site, in the form of 'Best and Worst,' with both yearly and monthly updates, and the worst will definitely be with me laughing as I write it.</p>

          <p>Today's featured movie is Revenge of the Sith, which is the best of the prequels in my opinion, which I'll post later on after the review.</p>
